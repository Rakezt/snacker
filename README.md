Snacker is a quirky little React app built with **Material UI** that makes your tea breaks smarter (and funnier). We all know how it goes — the more friends join, the more tea, the more cigarettes, the more snacks… and the more *utter confusion* when it’s time to pay. Why let the poor pan dukander play accountant when you’ve got **Snacker**?

With Snacker, you can:

* Add tea, cigarettes, juices, snacks, and other guilty pleasures.
* Assign prices and keep track of how much damage your break is doing to your wallet.
* Update quantities when someone yells “One more chai!”
* Automatically calculate the total (because math is boring).
* Keep arguments short, sweet, and funny — “Snacker says YOU pay.”

**No more confusion. No more finger-pointing. Just tea, snacks, and peace ✌️.**
